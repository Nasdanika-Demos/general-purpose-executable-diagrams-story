Catalogs may be implemented in a variety of ways:

* Text file  
* Web/wiki page
* Spreadsheet
* Web application
* Generator

They may contain:

* Processors
* Specifications
* URIs
* Shapes
* Groups of shapes (patterns)

They may form a hierarchy following the organization hierarchy and technology stack.

Catalogs allow to codify decision binding at the right level and make it easy to modify that binding and propagate the change down the decision binding graph.
