Librarians can create multiple URIs for a single processor or specification by binding variation points to different values. 
URIs may form a tree or graph of specialization - from more generic but requiring more inputs from mappers and consumers to more specific.

URIs can also be organized into a design space. In the design space dimensions correspond to variation points. 
The space is a Cartesian product of design dimensions. 
It is populated with designs, concrete instantiations of URIs, iterating over design choices - selections of actual values for design dimensions/variation points.
Design spaces may be quite large and even infinite. 
They can be generated automatically.

Design spaces can be used to select a design which is most appropriate for a given task. 
Similar to designs, tasks (problems) can form a space with dimensions. 
Therefore, design spaces can be used to create recommendations by matching designs in the design space to tasks in the task space.

To make it more concrete - there is a task space of getting somewhere. 
And a design space of methods of transportation. 
So you walk inside your house and possibly in your neighborhood, drive to a grocery store, fly by plane or drive to another city or country or continent, and take a spaceship to another planet.
