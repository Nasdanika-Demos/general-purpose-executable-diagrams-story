Custom libraries contain diagram elements with pre-set URIs or groups of elements (patterns).
They can be created manually or automatically. 
For example a catalog web application may support creation of custom libraries where users select URIs to include and may customize the URIs using wizards.

Also, libraries may be organized into a hierarchy/graph, possibly following the organization hierarchy and organization technology stack. 
It would allow to bind high-level design decisions at the higher levels of the hierarchy while allowing customization at the lower levels.
