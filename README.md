# Diagramming process

Diagramming is a process with multiple participants, activities, and artifacts. 
It is an [enterprise](https://enterprise.models.nasdanika.org/) with a mission to bind decisions to make them executable.

This repository defines a [diagramming process](https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/general-purpose-executable-diagrams-story/) for Drawio diagrams which use [URI Invocable processors](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/capability/index.html#loading-invocables-from-uris). 

Please note that one person can represent multiple participants (roles) and vice versa. 
You may clone or fork this repository and customize to your needs.
