Source repositories can be used to store non-derived artifacts - Java sources, scripts, diagrams, YAML/JSON specifications.

Some options:

* File systems, 
* Version control systems like Git including GitHub and GitLab
* Confluence for diagrams. Diagrammers can edit diagrams in Confluence and then REST API can be used to retrieve diagram sources for processing, e.g. generation of documentation sites.
