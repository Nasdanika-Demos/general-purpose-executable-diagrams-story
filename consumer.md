Consumers (Operators/Users) execute Java/CLI applications which leverage scripts, diagrams, and invocable URIs.

Operators may customize Maven configuration for loading dependencies. E.g. point to a corporate binary repository.

They also have control over system properties and environment variables which may be used in invocable URIs or be invocable URIs themselves.
