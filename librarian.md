Librarians create YAML/JSON specifications Java, scripts and diagrams. 
They may specify properties/bindings and, in the future releases, inheritance.

Librarians also create and publish catalogs of available building blocks - Java/Maven modules, scripts, diagrams, URIs. 
Librarians can use Wikis, GitHub pages, ...

Catalogs may have multiple dimensions - technology, organization, geography, ...

For diagrams librarians also may create [libraries of reusable diagram elements](https://www.drawio.com/blog/custom-libraries), including groups of elements (patterns). 
Libraries can be stored in a source repository system. 
With GitHub libraries can be published using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [JSDELIVR](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github) CDN. 
Drawio browser app can load libraries from a multitude of sources, including GitHub.

Librarians may also create and publish URI construction wizard applications where a URI is constructed based on user choices.
Something similar to [Drawio custom link tool](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio-tools/tools/link.html).
